EVERY hanging vine (including the breaks) is designed to have a 1vox (0.1vox) gap in between the wall and the vine.

EVERY vine (excluding the "experimental" crawl all sides and full cube) is designed to align with the backwall of a cube which is placed underneath/behind it. In other words, if you were to place a 10x10x10vox (standard) cube behind the model and aligned it with its back wall, it should always get properly aligned in the world.

Excluding the experimental pieces, EVERY vine model is always 10 wide ("x":).

Color guide:
- Every dark red cube is 10x10x10
- Every light red signifies that the model exceeds the basic diameter in that direction and by how much
