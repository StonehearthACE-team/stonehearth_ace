All the recipes belonging to the "refinement_seeds" category with "manual_unlock": true are wiped out at the game start and repopulated based on the biome (they don't carry between reembarked sessions).
If you want a "manual_unlock": true recipe to carry on after reembarking it must be put in a different category.
