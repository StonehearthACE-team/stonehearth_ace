heatmaps:
	- appeal (reworked to use generic heatmap service)
	- wilderness
	- ore-scouter
		- _get_heatmap_value function looks down X units from terrain point; value is sum of 1/depth for each ore found

should be flexible enough with passed functions and values to allow many uses
	- e.g., values could be tables, so 'default value' must be specifiable and not restricted by type
